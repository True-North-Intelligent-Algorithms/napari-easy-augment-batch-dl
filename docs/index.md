# Napari Easy Augment Batch DL

🚀 **Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl** is a plugin for advanced 2D deep learning segmentation.  It supports advanced options for augmention, model training and prediction in **Napari**.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **Batch Processing** – Label, augment, train and predict with multiple images at once.  
✅ **Easy Labeling** – Quickly assign labels using the intuitive Napari GUI.  
✅ **Advanced Augmentations** – Options for color augmentations, elastic deformation, tunable rescaling and more.  
✅ **Plugin multiple DL Frameworks** –  A plugin mechanism allows different deep learning frameworks such as Stardist, Cellpose, MobileSam, MicroSam, Monai and others to be integrated.  

## 📖 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Load and Label** – Import images and draw labels.  
2️⃣ **Generate Augmentations** – Choose transformations like rotation, flipping, or color augmentation and generate augmentations.  
3️⃣ **Train & Predict** – Train different models with same augmentation set and evaluate results.  

## 🚀 Get Started  
1. Install the plugin:  

You can install the plugin via the pip or the [Napari Hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl)

Please note that you will also need to install one or more deep learning frameworks for the plugin to be useful.  See the [dependencies](https://true-north-intelligent-algorithms.github.io/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl/augment/) page. 

   ```sh  
   pip install napari-easy-augment-batch-dl
   ```
