# About Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl

Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl is a user-friendly plugin for Napari designed to make batch image augmentation and model training more reproducible . It provides an intuitive graphical interface , integrated with Napari, that allows users to load and label images, apply augmentations, and process large datasets efficiently without requiring programming knowledge.  While the plugin complements programming by streamlining workflows, I always encourage users to learn programming, as it provides deeper flexibility and control over their data and models.

## 🔍 Features
- Takes advantage of Napari's build in labelling functionality Easy-to-use GUI .
- Supports various augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, noise addition, and brightness adjustments.
- Explicitly saves augmented patches for easier trouble shooting and more repeatible training. 
- Streamlined workflow with three simple steps: Load & Label, Configure Augmentations, and Train & Predict.
- Plugin mechanism to support training 
- Ideal for researchers, data scientists, and image analysis professionals.

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary goal of Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl is to bridge the gap between advanced image augmentation techniques and users who need a simple, no-code solution. Whether you are working with machine learning datasets, medical imaging, or scientific research, this tool helps you prepare high-quality augmented images efficiently.
