# About Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl

Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-dl is a user-friendly plugin for Napari designed to make labeling, batch image augmentation and model training more reproducible . It provides an intuitive graphical interface integrated with Napari, that allows users to load and label images, apply augmentations, and process large datasets efficiently without requiring programming knowledge.  (While the plugin complements programming by streamlining workflows, I always encourage users to learn programming, as it provides deeper flexibility and control over their data and models).

## 🔍 Features
- Takes advantage of Napari's built in labelling functionality.
- Supports various augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, noise addition, and brightness adjustments.
- Explicitly saves augmented patches for easier trouble shooting and more repeatable training.  
- Streamlined workflow with three simple steps: Load & Label, Augmentat, and Train & Predict.
- Plugin mechanism to support training and prediction with different frameworks (Cellpose, Stardist, SAM, Yolo, UNET, and more)
